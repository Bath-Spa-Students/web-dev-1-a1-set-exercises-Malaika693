    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and garlic, cooking for 5 minutes until softened. Next, add mince and brown thoroughly</li>
<li>Stir in tomatoes and sprinkle dried oregano over the mixture. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 180°C and grease a medium ovenproof baking dish. Arrange ¼ of the Lasagna sheets on the base, trimming them as needed to fit.</li>
<li>Spoon 1/3 of the mince mixture over the Lasagna sheets and cover with a generous layer of béchamel sauce</li>
<li>Repeat the layering process twice more. Top the final layer of béchamel sauce with Lasagna sheets and spread the remaining béchamel over them</li>
<li>Sprinkle cheese over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes until the pasta is tender and cheese turns golden brown. If needed, cover the dish with foil during baking to prevent the cheese from burning</li>
